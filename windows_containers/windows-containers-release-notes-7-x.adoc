== About {productwinc}

{productwinc} enables running Windows compute nodes in an {product-title} cluster. Running Windows workloads is possible by using the Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) to install and manage Windows nodes. With Windows nodes available, you can run Windows container workloads in {product-title}.

The release notes for {productwinc} track the development of the WMCO, which provides all Windows container workload capabilities in {product-title}.

== Getting support

// wording taken and modified from https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#windows

{productwinc} is provided and available as an optional, installable component. {productwinc} is not part of the {product-title} subscription. It requires an additional Red Hat subscription and is supported according to the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/production/soc/[Scope of coverage] and link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/production/sla[Service level agreements].

You must have this separate subscription to receive support for {productwinc}. Without this additional Red Hat subscription, deploying Windows container workloads in production clusters is not supported. You can request support through the link:http://access.redhat.com/[Red Hat Customer Portal].

For more information, see the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy document for link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#windows[{productwinc}].

If you do not have this additional Red Hat subscription, you can use the Community Windows Machine Config Operator, a distribution that lacks official support.

== Release notes for Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator 7.0.0

This release of the WMCO provides new features and bug fixes for running Windows compute nodes in an {product-title} cluster. The components of the WMCO 7.0.0 were released in https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:9096[RHSA-2022:9096].

=== New features and improvements

[id="wmco-7-0-0-wicd"]
==== Windows Instance Config Daemon (WICD)

The Windows Instance Config Daemon (WICD) is now performing many of the tasks that were previously performed by the Windows Machine Config Bootstrapper (WMCB). The WICD is installed on your Windows nodes. Users do not need to interact with the WICD and should not experience any difference in WMCO operation.

[id="wmco-7-0-0-gcp"]
==== Support for clusters running on Google Cloud Platform
You can now run Windows Server 2022 nodes on a cluster installed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You can create a Windows `MachineSet` object on GCP to host Windows Server 2022 compute nodes. For more information, see xref:../windows_containers/creating_windows_machinesets/creating-windows-machineset-gcp.adoc#creating-windows-machineset-gcp[Creating a Windows MachineSet object on vSphere].

[id="wmco-7-0-0-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, restarting the WMCO in a cluster with running Windows Nodes caused the windows exporter endpoint to be removed. Because of this, each Windows node could not report any metrics data. After this fix, the endpoint is retained when the WMCO is restarted. As a result, metrics data is reported properly after restarting WMCO. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2107261[**BZ#2107261**])

* Previously, the test to determine if the Windows Defender antivirus service is running was incorrectly checking for any process whose name started with Windows Defender, regardless of state. This resulted in an error when creating firewall exclusions for containerd on instances without Windows Defender installed. This fix now checks for the presence of the specific running process associated with the Windows Defender antivirus service. As a result, the WMCO can properly configure Windows instances as nodes regardless of whether Windows Defender is installed or not. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3573[**OCPBUGS-3573**])

[id="wmco-7-0-0-known-issues"]
=== Known issues

The following known limitations have been announced after the previous WMCO release:

* {ServerlessProductName}, Horizontal Pod Autoscaling, and Vertical Pod Autoscaling are not supported on Windows nodes.

* {productwinc} does not support adding Windows nodes to a cluster through a trunk port. The only supported networking configuration for adding Windows nodes is through an access port that carries traffic for the VLAN.

* WMCO 7.0.0 does not support running in a namespace other than `openshift-windows-machine-operator`. If you are using a custom namespace, it is recommended that you not upgrade to WMCO 7.0.0. Instead, you should upgrade to WMCO 7.0.1 when it is released. If your WMCO is configured with the *Automatic* update approval strategy, you should change it to *Manual* for WMCO 7.0.0. See the xref:../windows_containers/enabling-windows-container-workloads.adoc#installing-wmco-using-web-console_enabling-windows-container-workloads[installation instructions] for information on changing the approval strategy.
