== About MicroShift

MicroShift is a distribution of {OCP} optimized for small form factors and edge computing.

Edge devices deployed in the field pose very different operational, environmental, and business challenges from those of cloud computing. These challenges motivate different engineering tradeoffs for Kubernetes at the far edge than for cloud or near-edge scenarios. MicroShift's design goals cater to these factors, including:

* Minimizing the use of system resources, such as CPU, memory, network, and storage
* Tolerating severe networking constraints
* Securely and seamlessly updating, without disrupting workloads
* Extending and integrating cleanly with edge-optimized operating systems, like Fedora IoT and {op-system-first}
* Providing a consistent development and management experience with other distributions of {OCP}
