== Internal load balancer missing form Azure provider specification

The `internalLoadBalancer` parameter is required in both the `ControlPlaneMachineSet` and control plane `Machine` CRs, but might not be prepopulated. If this parameter is not populated in those CRs on your cluster, you must populate it on both CRs.

For more information on where this parameter is located in the Azure provider specification, see xref:../../machine_management/control_plane_machine_management/cpmso-configuration.adoc#cpmso-yaml-provider-spec-azure_cpmso-configuration[Sample Azure provider specification].

//Would like to include some detail about the machine CR too, need to see if we have tha structure somewhere.
