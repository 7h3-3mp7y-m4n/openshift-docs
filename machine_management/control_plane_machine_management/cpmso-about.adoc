toc::[]

With the Control Plane Machine Set Operator, you can automate management of the control plane machine resources within your {product-title} cluster. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Control plane machine sets cannot manage compute machines, and compute machine sets cannot manage control plane machines.
====

//Trying to balance the two being analogous (so, familiar to admins), but not the same (so, not conflated by admins). I think this language needs a lot of careful scrutiny and consideration.
Control plane machine sets provide for control plane machines similar management capabilities as compute machine sets provide for compute machines. However, these two types of machine sets are separate custom resources defined within the Machine API and have several fundamental differences in their architecture and functionality.

== Limitations

In {product-title} {product-version}, the Control Plane Machine Set Operator has the following limitations:

* Only clusters with three control plane machines are supported.

* Horizontal scaling of the control plane is not supported.
