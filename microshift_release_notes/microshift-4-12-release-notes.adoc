// Update All for MicroShift; text is FPO (for placement only)
Red Hat {product-title} provides developers and IT organizations with small form factor and edge computing, delivered as an application that customers can deploy on top of their managed {op-system-first} devices at the edge. Built on {op-system-first} and Kubernetes, {product-title} provides an efficient way to operate single-node clusters in low-resource edge environments.

{product-title} is designed to make control plane restarts economical and be lifecycle-managed as a single unit by the operating system. Updates, roll-backs, and configuration changes consist of simply staging another version in parallel and then - without relying on a network - flipping to and from that version and restarting.
