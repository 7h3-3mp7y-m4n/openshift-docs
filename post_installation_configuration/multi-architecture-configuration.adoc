= Configuring multi-architecture compute machines on an {product-title} cluster 
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

An {product-title} cluster with multi-architecture compute machines is a cluster that supports compute machines with different architectures. Clusters with multi-architecture compute machines are available only on AWS or Azure installer-provisioned infrastructures and bare metal user-provisioned infrastructures with `x86_64` control plane machines. 

For information on migrating your single-architecture cluster to a cluster that supports multi-architecture compute machines, see xref:../updating/migrating-to-multi-payload.adoc#migrating-to-multi-payload[Migrating to a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines].

== Creating a cluster with multi-architecture compute machine on Azure 

To deploy an Azure cluster with multi-architecture compute machines, you must first create a single-architecture Azure installer-provisioned cluster that uses the multi-architecture installer binary. For more information on Azure installations, see xref:../installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-customizations.adoc[Installing a cluster on Azure with customizations]. You can then add an `arm64` compute machine set to your cluster to create a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines. 

The following procedures explain how to generate an `arm64` boot image and create an Azure compute machine set that uses the `arm64` boot image. This adds `arm64` compute nodes to your cluster and deploys the amount of `arm64` virtual machines (VM) that you need.

== Creating a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines on AWS

To create an AWS cluster with multi-architecture compute machines, you must first create a single-architecture AWS installer-provisioned cluster with the multi-architecture installer binary. For more information on AWS installations, refer to xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-customizations.adoc[Installing a cluster on AWS with customizations]. You can then add a ARM64 compute machine set to your AWS cluster.
