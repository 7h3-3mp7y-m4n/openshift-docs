When a persistent volume claim (PVC) is deleted, the underlying logical volume is handled according to the `reclaimPolicy`.

.Procedure
To manually reclaim the PV as a cluster administrator:

. Delete the PV.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete pv <pv-name>
----

. Clean up the data on the associated storage asset.

. Delete the associated storage asset. Alternately, to reuse the same storage asset, create a new PV with the storage asset definition.

The reclaimed PV is now available for use by another PVC.
