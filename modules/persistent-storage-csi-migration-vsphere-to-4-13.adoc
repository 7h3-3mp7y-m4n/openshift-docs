= Updating from {product-title} 4.12 to 4.13

If you are using vSphere in-tree persistent volumes (PVs) and want to update from {product-title} 4.12 to 4.13, update vSphere vCenter and ESXI host to 7.0 Update 3L or 8.0 Update 2, otherwise the {product-title} update is blocked. After updating vSphere, your {product-title} update can occur and automatic Container Storage Interface (CSI) migration for vSphere only occurs if you opt in.

Alternatively, if you do not want to update vSphere, you can proceed with an {product-title} update by running the following command to perform an administrator acknowledgment:

[source, cli]
----
oc -n openshift-config patch cm admin-acks --patch '{"data":{"ack-4.12-kube-126-vsphere-migration-in-4.14":"true"}}' --type=merge
----

It is generally safe to provide the requested administrator acknowledgment for updates from {product-title} 4.12 to 4.13 because CSI migration is not yet enabled for upgraded clusters from 4.12 to 4.13. However, Red Hat recommends that you start planning an update of your vSphere environment for a future update to 4.14, so that all the in-tree volumes can be managed by the CSI driver seamlessly.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do *not* update to {product-title} 4.13.10, or later, and do *not* update vSphere, and then opt in to migration (see _Using the web console to opt in to automatic CSI migration_ or _Using the CLI to opt in to automatic CSI migration_ below), known issues can occur. Review the consequences listed above for migration before opting in and link:https://access.redhat.com/node/7011683[carefully read this knowledge base article].
