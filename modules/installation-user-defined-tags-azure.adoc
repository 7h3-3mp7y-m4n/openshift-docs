= Configuring the user-defined tags for Azure

In {product-title}, you can use the tags for grouping resources and for managing resource access and cost. You can define the tags on the Azure resources in the `install-config.yaml` file only during {product-title} cluster creation. You cannot modify the user-defined tags after cluster creation.

Support for user-defined tags is available only for the resources created in the Azure Public Cloud, and in {product-title} 4.13 as a Technology Preview (TP). User-defined tags are not supported for the {product-title} clusters upgraded to {product-title} 4.13.

User-defined and {product-title} specific tags are applied only to the resources created by the {product-title} installer and its core operators such as Machine api provider azure Operator, Cluster Ingress Operator, Cluster Image Registry Operator.

By default, {product-title} installer attaches the {product-title} tags to the Azure resources. These {product-title} tags are not accessible for the users.

You can use the `.platform.azure.userTags` field in the `install-config.yaml` file to define the list of user-defined tags as shown in the following `install-config.yaml` file.

----
<1> Defines the trust bundle policy.
<2> Required. The `baseDomain` parameter specifies the base domain of your cloud provider. The installation program prompts you for this value.
<3> You must set the `featureSet` field as `TechPreviewNoUpgrade`.
<4> The configuration for the machines that comprise compute. The `compute` section is a sequence of mappings. To meet the requirements of the different data structures, the first line of the `compute` section must begin with a hyphen, `-`. If you do not provide these parameters and values, the installation program provides the default value.
<5> To enable or disable simultaneous multithreading, or `hyperthreading`. By default, simultaneous multithreading is enabled to increase the performance of your machines' cores. You can disable it by setting the parameter value to `Disabled`. If you disable simultaneous multithreading in some cluster machines, you must disable it in all cluster machines.
<6> The configuration for the machines that comprise the control plane. The `controlPlane` section is a single mapping. The first line of the `controlPlane` section must not begin with a hyphen, `-`. You can use only one control plane pool. If you do not provide these parameters and values, the installation program provides the default value.
<7> To enable or disable simultaneous multithreading, or `hyperthreading`. By default, simultaneous multithreading is enabled to increase the performance of your machines' cores. You can disable it by setting the parameter value to `Disabled`. You cannot disable simultaneous multithreading in selected cluster machines. If you disable simultaneous multithreading in some cluster machines, you must disable it in all cluster machines.
<8> The installation program prompts you for this value.
<9> The cluster network plugin to install. The supported values are `OVNKubernetes` and `OpenShiftSDN`. The default value is `OVNKubernetes`.
<10> Specifies the resource group for the base domain of the Azure DNS zone.
<11> Specifies the name of the Azure cloud environment while configuring the Azure SDK with the Azure API endpoints. If you do not provide value, the default value is `AzurePublicCloud`.
<12> Required. Specifies the name of the Azure region that hosts your cluster. The installation program prompts you for this value.
<13> Defines the additional keys and values that the installation program adds as tags to all Azure resources that it creates.

The user-defined tags have the following limitations:

* A tag key can have a maximum of 128 characters.
* A tag key must begin with a letter, end with a letter, number or underscore, and can contain only letters, numbers, underscores, periods, and hyphens.
* Tag keys are case-insensitive.
* Tag keys cannot be `name`. It cannot have prefixes such as `kubernetes.io`, `openshift.io`, `microsoft`, `azure`, and `windows`.
* A tag value can have a maximum of 256 characters.
* You can configure a maximum of 10 tags for resource group and resources.
