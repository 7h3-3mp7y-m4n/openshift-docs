= Setting the LVMS path 

The `config.yaml` file for the LMVS should be written to the same directory as the MicroShift `config.yaml` file. If a MicroShift `config.yaml` file does not exist, MicroShift will create an LVMS YAML and automatically populate the configuration fields with the default settings. The following paths are checked for the `config.yaml` file, depending on which user runs MicroShift: 

.LVMS paths 
[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
| MicroShift user | Configuration directory 
|Global administrator | `/etc/microshift/lvmd.yaml`
