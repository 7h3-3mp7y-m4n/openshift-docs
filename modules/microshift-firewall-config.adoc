= Using a firewall
Firewalls are not required in {product-title}, but using a firewall can prevent undesired access to the {product-title} API. When using a firewall, you must explicitly allow the following OVN-Kubernetes traffic when the `firewalld` service is running:

CNI pod to CNI pod::
CNI pod to Host-Network pod
Host-Network pod to Host-Network pod

CNI pod::
The Kubernetes pod that uses the CNI network

Host-Network pod::
The Kubernetes pod that uses host network
 Install and configure the `firewalld` service by using the following procedures.
//Q: Are there networking prerequisites for this procedure, such as having already installed the OpenShift DNS Operator?

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} pods must have access to the internal CoreDNS component and API servers.

== Installing the `firewalld` service
To install and run the `firewalld` service, run the following commands:

.Procedure

. To install the `firewalld` service:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo dnf install -y firewalld
----

. To initiate the firewall:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo systemctl enable firewalld --now
----

[id="microshift-required-settings_{context}"]
== Required settings
An IP address range for pods is a required part of the firewall configuration. You can use the default values or customize the IP address range. You must also configure pod access to the internal CoreDNS component.

.Required settings
[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|===
^| IR Range ^| Description

|10.42.0.0/16
|Host network pod access to CoreDNS and {product-title} API

|169.254.169.1
|Host network pod access to {product-title} API Server
|===

.Procedure

. Run the following commands to allow network traffic by first configuring the IP address range with either default or custom values, then allow internal traffic from pods through the network gateway by inserting the DNS server.

.. To use default values for the IP address range:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo firewall-offline-cmd --permanent --zone=trusted --add-source=10.42.0.0/16
----

.. To allow internal traffic from pods through the network gateway:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ sudo firewall-offline-cmd --permanent --zone=trusted --add-source=169.254.169.1
----

. To use custom values for the IP address range:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo firewall-offline-cmd --permanent --zone=trusted --add-source=<custom IP range>
----

. To allow internal traffic from pods through the network gateway:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo firewall-offline-cmd --permanent --zone=trusted --add-source=169.254.169.1
----

. Reload the firewall rules:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ sudo firewall-cmd --reload
----

[id="microshift-firewall-optional-settings_{context}"]
== Optional settings

.Procedure

. To add customized ports to your firewall configuration, use the following command syntax:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo firewall-offline-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=<port number>/<port protocol>
----
+

=== Known firewall issue
To avoid breaking traffic flows with a firewall restart, execute firewall commands before starting OVN-Kubernetes pods. OVN-Kubernetes makes use of iptable rules for some traffic flows, such as those using the NodePort service. The iptable rules are generated and inserted by the `ovnkube-master` container, but are deleted when the firewall restarts. The absence of the iptable rules breaks traffic flows. If firewall commands have to be executed after OVN-Kubernetes pods have started, manually restart the `ovnkube-master` pod to trigger a reconciliation of the iptable rules.

== Applying firewall settings
After you have finished configuring, run the following command to restart the firewall and apply settings:

[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo firewall-offline-cmd --reload

//Q: How do we verify? What should we see after running this command?
