= vSphere automatic migration

[IMPORTANT]
====
Migration includes significant consequences:

* Enabling migration cannot be undone.

* Migration can take a while to complete depending on how many nodes are on the cluster.
====

== New installations of {product-title}
For new installations of {product-title} 4.13, or later, automatic migration is enabled by default.

== Updating from {product-title} 4.13 to 4.14
If you are using vSphere in-tree persistent volumes (PVs) and want to update from {product-title} 4.13 to 4.14, first update vSphere vCenter and ESXI host to 7.0 Update 3L or 8.0 Update 2, otherwise the {product-title} update is blocked. After updating vSphere, your {product-title} update can occur and automatic migration is enabled by default.

Alternatively, if you do not want to update vSphere, you can proceed with an {product-title} update by performing an administrator acknowledgment:

[source, cli]
----
oc -n openshift-config patch cm admin-acks --patch '{"data":{"ack-4.13-kube-127-vsphere-migration-in-4.14":"true"}}' --type=merge
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do *not* update to vSphere 7.0 Update 3L or 8.0 Update 2 and use an administrator acknowledgment to update to {product-title} 4.14, known issues can occur. link:https://access.redhat.com/node/7011683[Before proceeding with the administrator acknowledgement, carefully read this knowledge base article].
====

== Updating from {product-title} 4.12 to 4.13
If you are using vSphere in-tree persistent volumes (PVs) and want to update from {product-title} 4.12 to 4.13, update vSphere vCenter and ESXI host to 7.0 Update 3L or 8.0 Update 2, otherwise the {product-title} update is blocked. After updating vSphere, your {product-title} update can occur and automatic CSI migration for vSphere only occurs if you opt in.

Alternatively, if you do not want to update vSphere, you can proceed with an {product-title} update by running the following command to perform an administrator acknowledgment:

[source, cli]
----
oc -n openshift-config patch cm admin-acks --patch '{"data":{"ack-4.12-kube-126-vsphere-migration-in-4.14":"true"}}' --type=merge
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do *not* update to {product-title} 4.13.10, or later, and do *not* update vSphere, and then opt in to migration, known issues can occur. Review the consequences listed above for migration before opting in and link:https://access.redhat.com/node/7011683[carefully read this knowledge base article].

== Using the web console to opt in to automatic CSI migration

=== Prerequisites

* Access to the {product-title} web console.

* Access to the cluster with cluster-admin privileges.

=== Procedure

To opt in to automatic CSI migration for vSphere:

. Log in to the web console.

. Click *Administration* -> *CustomResourceDefinitions*.

. On the *CustomResourceDefinitions* page, type "Storage" to find the `Storage` custom resource (CR).

. Click the *Storage* CR.

. On the *storages.operator.openshift.io* page, click the *Instances* tab.

. Click the name of the desired instance, and then click the *YAML* tab.

. Set the `spec.vsphereStorageDriver` parameter to `CSIWithMigrationDriver`, as shown in the following example:
+
[source, yaml]
----
....
spec:
  logLevel: Normal
  managementState: Managed
  operatorLogLevel: Normal
  vsphereStorageDriver: CSIWithMigrationDriver <1>
...
----
<1> `spec.vsphereStorageDriver` parameter set to `CSIWithMigrationDriver`

. Click *Save*.

== Using the CLI to opt in to automatic CSI migration

=== Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster with cluster-admin privileges.

=== Procedure

To opt in to automatic CSI migration for vSphere, run the following command:

[source, cli]
----
oc patch storage cluster --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"vsphereStorageDriver":"CSIWithMigrationDriver"}}'
----

[NOTE]
====
You can determine when migration is complete by verifying that the `VSphereMigrationControllerAvailable` condition is set to "true" in the `Storage` object.
