= Running additional services in the encapsulated namespace

Any monitoring tool that relies on the ability to run in the host OS and have visibility of mountpoints created by kubelet, CRI-O, or containers themselves, must enter the container mount namespace to see these mountpoints. The `kubensenter` script that comes with {product-title} executes another command inside the Kubernetes mountpoint and can be used to adapt any existing tools.

The `kubensenter` script is aware of the state of the mount encapsulation feature status, and is safe to run even if encapsulation is not enabled. In that case the script executes the provided command in the default mount namespace.

For example, if a systemd service needs to run inside the new Kubernetes mount namespace, edit the service file and use the `ExecStart=` command line with `kubensenter`.
