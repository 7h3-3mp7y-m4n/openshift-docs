= How manifests work with kustomize

Providing multiple directories allows a flexible method of managing {product-title} workloads. When you run the `kustomize` configuration management tool, {product-title} searches the `/etc/microshift/manifests` and `/usr/lib/microshift/` manifest directories for a `kustomization.yaml` file. If it finds one, {product-title} automatically runs the `kubectl apply -k` command to apply the manifests to the cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `kustomize` tool must be either running as a separate step in the boot process, or it must be part of the {product-title} image.
