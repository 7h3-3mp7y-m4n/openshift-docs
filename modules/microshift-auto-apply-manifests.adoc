[id="microshift-auto-apply-manifests_{context}"]
= Automatically applying manifests with `kustomize`

 Providing multiple directories allows a flexible method of managing {product-title} workloads. When you run the `kustomize` configuration management tool, {product-title} searches the `/etc/microshift/manifests` and `/usr/lib/microshift/` manifest directories for a `kustomization.yaml` file. If it finds one, {product-title} automatically runs the `kubectl apply -k` command to apply the manifests to the cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `kustomize` tool must be either running as a separate step in the boot process, or it must be part of the {product-title} image.

== Manifest example
This example demonstrates automatic deployment of a BusyBox container using `kustomize` manifests in the `/etc/microshift/manifests` directory.

.Procedure
. Create the BusyBox manifest files by running the following commands:
+
* Define the directory location.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ MANIFEST_DIR=/etc/microshift/manifests
----
+
* Make the directory by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo mkdir -p ${MANIFEST_DIR}
----
+
* Place the `yaml` file in the directory.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo tee ${MANIFEST_DIR}/busybox.yaml &>/dev/null <<EOF

.Procedure
. Create the `kustomize` manifest files by running the following commands:
+
* Run the command to read and write the standard inputs.
[source,terminal]

----
$ sudo tee
----
* Apply the `yaml` configuration.

[source,terminal]

----

. Restart {product-title} to apply the manifests and verify that the BusyBox pod is running by running the following commands:
+
* Restart {product-title}.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo systemctl restart microshift
----
+
* Apply the manifests and start the BusyBox pod.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n busybox
----

// what's the verification look like?
