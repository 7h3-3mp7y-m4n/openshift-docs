= Configuring disk partitioning with SiteConfig

Use a `SiteConfig` CR to generate the `MachineConfig` CR used for disk partitioning. Prior to installation, you need to modify values in the `SiteConfig` CR to reflect dependencies on the underlying disk.

[NOTE]
====
You must use persistent naming for devices to avoid device names such as `/dev/sda` and `/dev/sdb` being switched at every reboot. You can use `rootDeviceHints` to choose the bootable device and then use same device for further partitioning: in this case, for Image registry.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed and configured Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP). For information about this, see the topic on ZTP in Additional resources.

.Procedure

. Add the following YAML to the `SiteConfig` CR that you use to generate the `MachineConfig` CR for disk partitioning:
+
[source,yaml]
----
nodes:
  - rootDeviceHints:
      wwn: "0x62cea7f05c98c2002708a0a22ff480ea"
    diskPartition:
    - device: /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x62cea7f05c98c2002708a0a22ff480ea <1>
      partitions:
       - mount_point: /var/imageregistry
         size: 102500 <2>
         start: 344844 <3>
----
<1> This setting depends on the hardware. The setting can be a serial number or device name. The value must match the entry for `rootDeviceHint`.
<2> The minimum value for `size` is 102500 MiB.
<3> The minimum value for `start` is 25000 MiB. The total value of `size` and `start` must not exceed the disk size, or the installation will fail.
