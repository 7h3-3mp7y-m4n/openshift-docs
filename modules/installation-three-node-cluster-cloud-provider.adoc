= Configuring a three-node cluster

You configure a three-node cluster by setting the number of worker nodes to `0` in the `install-config.yaml` file before deploying the cluster. Setting the number of worker nodes to `0` ensures that the control plane machines are schedulable. This allows application workloads to be scheduled to run from the control plane nodes.

[NOTE]
====
Because application workloads run from control plane nodes, additional subscriptions are required, as the control plane nodes are considered to be compute nodes.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have an existing `install-config.yaml` file.

.Procedure

. Set the number of compute replicas to `0` in your `install-config.yaml` file, as shown in the following `compute` stanza:
+
[source,yaml]
----
compute:
- name: worker
  platform: {}
  replicas: 0
----
. If you are deploying a cluster with user-provisioned infrastructure, do not create additional worker nodes.

.Verification

To verify that the control plane nodes are schedulable, open the `cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml` Kubernetes manifest file and confirm that the `spec.mastersSchedulable` parameter is set to `true`. You can locate this file in `<installation_directory>/manifests`.

* If you install a cluster on infrastructure that the installation program provisions, you can complete this verification step after the cluster is deployed.
* If you install a cluster on infrastructure that you provision, you can complete this verification step after creating the Kubernetes manifest and Ignition configuration files.
