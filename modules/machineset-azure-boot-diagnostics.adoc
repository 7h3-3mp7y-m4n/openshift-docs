= Enabling Azure boot diagnostics on compute machines

You can enable boot diagnostics on Azure machines that your compute machine set creates.

.Prerequisites

* Have an existing Microsoft Azure
ifdef::ash[Stack Hub]
cluster.

.Procedure

* Add the `diagnostics` configuration that is applicable to your storage type to the `providerSpec` field in your compute machine set YAML file:

** For an Azure Managed storage account:
+
[source,yaml]
----
providerSpec:
  diagnostics:
    boot:
      storageAccountType: AzureManaged <1>
----
+
<1> Specifies an Azure Managed storage account.

** For an Azure Unmanaged storage account:
+
[source,yaml]
----
providerSpec:
  diagnostics:
    boot:
      storageAccountType: CustomerManaged <1>
      customerManaged:
        storageAccountURI: https://<storage-account>.blob.core.windows.net <2>
----
+
<1> Specifies an Azure Unmanaged storage account.
<2> Replace `<storage-account>` with the name of your storage account. 
+
[NOTE]

Only the Azure Blob Storage data service is supported.

.Verification

* On the Microsoft Azure portal, review the *Boot diagnostics* page for a machine deployed by the compute machine set, and verify that you can see the serial logs for the machine.
